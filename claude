Yes, it's certainly possible to combine both Java and Python in one project. Here is one way the project structure could look:

- Backend/Server

    - Java server (Spring Boot)
        - Runs the core backend API
        - Handles databases, authentication, business logic
        - Exposes REST endpoints
        
- Web Scraping

    - Python scripts
        - Use libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy etc.
        - Extract data from websites
        - Save scraped data to files/database
        
- File Conversion

    - Python scripts 
        - Use libraries like pdf2image, docx2pdf
        - Convert files to different formats
        - Triggered by backend APIs
        
- Frontend

    - React/Angular/Vue
        - Provides web UI
        - Calls Java backend APIs
        - Uploads files that get processed

#The Java backend acts as the central hub - it exposes APIs for the frontend, triggers Python scraping scripts, coordinates file conversion, and manages the database.

#Python is used where it's most suited - for rapidly developing scripts to scrape websites and convert file formats.

Benefits of this architecture:

- Leverage strengths of both languages
- Backend services in Java are robust and scalable
- Frontend remains decoupled from backend  
- Rapid prototyping of scrapers and file converters in Python
- Clean separation of concerns

#The key is defining clear interfaces between the different components. The Java backend orchestrates calls to Python through shell commands, APIs, queues etc.

Here is one way the project structure could look using Django in addition to Java and Python:

- Backend
    - Java (Spring Boot) 
        - Core backend APIs and services
        - Database/business logic
    - Django (Python)
        - Custom admin portal
        - User management 
        - CRUD models/APIs
        - Integrate with Java backend
- Python Scripts
    - Web scraping
    - File conversion
- Frontend 
    - React/Angular/Vue
        - Public web UI
        - Calls Java and Django APIs
        
#In this setup, Django serves as the web framework to handle admin interfaces and basic CRUD functionality.

Some reasons to use Django in addition to Java:

- Rapidly build admin portals and CRUD operations
- Take advantage of Django ORM for faster dev than Hibernate
- Django admin generator saves development time
- Better session management and authentication than Spring 

#The Java backend still handles core services, databases and business logic. Django integrates with Java using REST APIs.

#Benefits of this architecture:

- Java for core backend services
- Django for admin portal and basic CRUD 
- Keep frontend decoupled
- Leverage strengths of Java and Python
- Streamlined development using Django ORM and admin 

#The key would be clearly separating the responsibilities between the Java backend and Django frontend. Django accesses Java APIs to sync data/authentication.
